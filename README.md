# Lean-Falso

This is an implementation of the [Falso (TM)](http://inutile.club/estatis/falso/) HyperProver (TM), written in the process of learning Lean. I do not guarantee it is in any way as performant as other implementations of Falso (TM), or, indeed as powerful.

But it sure makes proving stuff **much** easier.
